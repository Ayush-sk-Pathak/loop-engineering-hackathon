## Changelog (append-only, newest at bottom)

### 2026-07-17 — Project scaffolded + concept locked

**Setup.** Doc system + anti-drift mechanisms laid down (vendored `starter-pack/`):
constitution (`CLAUDE.md`), placeholder `vision.md` (user approval pending — left
editable), this log, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/architecture.md`,
`docs/STRATEGY-LEDGER.md` (+ SessionStart injection hook), `docs/lessons_learned.md`,
`logs/DECISIONS.jsonl` (seeded 0001–0005) + `logs/errors.jsonl` (empty), and the
enforcement layer (`scripts/bootstrap.sh`: chmod 444 + pre-commit on vision/CLAUDE/architecture).

**Concept decided.** After multi-round brainstorming and a deep-research pass (103 sub-agents,
verified against `zero.xyz/browse`, the `zero-plugins` repo, Metaview and Nexla docs), the
team converged on **Aegis** — an autonomous procurement agent whose stockout-rescue loop has
fraud defense built into every step. Full rationale and the rejected alternatives (Concepts
A/B/C and pure-software ideas) are in `docs/STRATEGY-LEDGER.md` decisions 2–5 and `docs/PRD.md`.

**Key research findings that shaped the design** (source: deep-research report, 2026-07-17):
- Zero.xyz does NOT broker credit-bureau / supplier-registry / fraud-score / freight data
  (kills the original Concepts A/B/C paid steps) → verify via enrichment + scrape + news +
  AI call instead (`STRATEGY-LEDGER` decision 3).
- Fillmore is recruiting-only → dropped; PO email via StableEmail (decision 4).
- Nexla FlexFlow (GA) is the trigger layer, not MCP Studio (Early Access) (decision 5).

**Not yet built.** No application code exists. Next session starts at `docs/ROADMAP.md`
Phase 0 → freeze the five interface signatures, then parallel build.

### 2026-07-17 — Infrastructure doc + judge-facing README

**Added.** `docs/infrastructure.md` — the end-to-end runtime infra: topology diagram, the
five deployable units + ports/trust-boundaries, the Pomerium-gated `POST /po` request path
step by step (how the `403` physically happens), the Zero.xyz x402 paid-call plumbing, the
Nexla trigger, secrets handling, and local-vs-Akash deployment (local-first; Akash is P2
coverage). Also added a public **`README.md`** (judge-facing): problem, the trust-loop, the
tool mapping, the embedded topology diagram (linking to the full infra doc), repo layout,
local quickstart, and the team split. `.gitignore` extended (user) to cover `data/`,
`coverage/`, `*.tsbuildinfo`. Key infra invariant documented: `services/procurement` is
reachable **only** through Pomerium — no route exists for the agent to bypass the gate.

### 2026-07-17 — Green vertical slice: monitor, signed attestations, pre-verification denial, infra

**Built (working tree integrated this session; tests 9/9, `tsc --noEmit` clean).**
The full local vertical slice now exists and runs: always-on inventory monitor
(`services/control-plane/src/monitor.ts`, 2s interval, threshold + idle + no-inbound guards);
agent loop that attempts the cheapest **unattested** PO first, observes the live 403, replans,
buys evidence, and orders with a signed capability (`services/agent/src/index.ts`);
HMAC-signed quote/payee/amount-bound `VendorAttestation` with nonce replay defense
(`packages/security`, `services/procurement`); deterministic vendor-risk policy v1.1
(`services/verification/src/policy.ts`); pluggable fixture/live_zero evidence collector
(`collector.ts`); Nexla webhook ingress (`POST /api/events/stockout`); ops dashboard with
decision trail. Infra: `Dockerfile`, `compose.yaml`, `deploy/akash/deploy.example.yaml`,
`infra/pomerium/vendor-policy.example.yaml`, `scripts/doctor.ts` readiness checker,
integration runbooks under `docs/integrations/` (ZERO, POMERIUM, NEXLA, AKASH), `docs/DEMO.md`
3-minute script, `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Decisions 0006–0010 recorded in `logs/DECISIONS.jsonl`.
Pending on-site: Zero service lock (`config/zero-services.json` empty), Pomerium route +
service accounts, StableEmail adapter, Nexla FlexFlow config, Akash deploy (P2).

### 2026-07-17 — Integration: branches merged, hero/subset reframe, horizontal scenario engine

**Merged.** `origin/main` (fd7cbe6: BUSINESS, PRODUCT_SCOPE, CASE_STUDIES, client mockup)
into `dev`; cherry-picked `toolsused.md` and the user-authored `vision.md` from
`origin/ayush` (that branch shares no git history with dev — a full merge would have
deleted the codebase, so files were adopted instead).

**Reframed (decision 0013, `logs/DECISIONS.jsonl`).** The hero across all docs is the
autonomous emergency-procurement rescue loop; vendor-risk/fraud defense is its built-in
trust subset. Applied to README, PRD, PROJECT_STATUS, STRATEGY-LEDGER (entry 13),
BUSINESS, CASE_STUDIES, PRODUCT_SCOPE, mockup titles. Contradictions with settled
decisions corrected in place: PRODUCT_SCOPE mock-registry mitigation (0003), Fillmore
stretch (0004), toolsused.md LLM-as-decider and Resend-first (0008/0004 — reconciliation
notes added; see also `docs/blueprint-reconciliation.md`, decision 0014).

**Built.** Horizontal scenario-profile engine (`services/verification/src/scenarios.ts`):
`datacenter` (default, DDR5-ECC-64GB + existing vendor pair) and `apparel`
(NAVY-DYE-20L, vendor-pacificdye typosquat vs vendor-meridian) run the identical loop;
`POST /api/demo/scenario` + dashboard toggle (disabled mid-run); scenario block on
`DemoState` (SCHEMA_VERSION unchanged, additive). New `scenarios.test.ts`.

**Verified (this commit).** `npm test` 11/11 pass; `npm run typecheck` exit 0;
`npm run build` exit 0. DEMO.md gained the optional "same loop, any industry" closer;
ROADMAP scenario-engine box ticked.

### 2026-07-17 — Learning Layer, exhaustive docs, advisor audit fixes, single-branch consolidation

**Built.** Learning Layer landed per decision 0015: `incidents` SQLite ledger written on
`complete()`; `DemoState.learning` (count, last resolution, proven vendors); `history()`
drives the loop — later runs emit `recalled_history` instead of the unattested probe and
rank proven vendors first; soft reset preserves the ledger, `POST /api/demo/reset
{"hard":true}` clears it; dashboard learning strip + Proven chips. New tests:
`services/agent/src/learning.test.ts`, `services/control-plane/src/store.test.ts`.

**Documented.** `docs/PRD.md` rewritten as the exhaustive product document (1,194 lines,
19 sections incl. decision index + glossary); new `docs/SYSTEM.md` (1,106 lines) — the
complete technical reference read from the code.

**Advisor audit (docs↔docs + docs↔code lenses) findings fixed:** stale 11/11 test counts
→ 15/15 (PRD); demo-script pointer `PRD §9` → `§14` (CLAUDE.md, STRATEGY-LEDGER);
SYSTEM.md §12 updated from "landing" to "landed", §13 test inventory 7→9 files, reset
endpoint hard-flag documented; `SCENARIO=datacenter` added to `config/example.env`;
**docs/DEMO.md now requires a hard reset before recording** — the learning ledger
otherwise suppresses the prize-critical denial beat on repeat runs.

**Workflow.** Single long-lived branch: `main` only (CLAUDE.md §Branch model,
CONTRIBUTING.md updated); `dev` and `ayush` remote branches deleted after their content
was fully merged/absorbed.

**Verified (this commit).** `npm test` 15/15 pass; `npm run typecheck` clean;
`npm run build` (check + Next production build) green.

### 2026-07-17 — Lane C (Nexla/dashboard/demo): W1 items (C1–C4)

**C1 — verified.** POSTed `config/nexla-stockout.example.json` to `/api/events/stockout`
on the isolated lane-C worktree stack (control `:4400`, procurement `:4401`,
`MONITOR_ENABLED=0`, `AUTH_MODE=development`, `VERIFICATION_MODE=fixture`). Measured result:
`202 {"accepted":true,"eventId":"nexla-event-001"}`; the run drained to `complete` with a
14-phase decision trail; **every decision event carried `correlationId: "nexla-event-001"`**
(= posted `eventId`, `services/agent/src/index.ts:67`); order `PO-45CA6A84`, 20 units
scheduled. Evidence recorded in `docs/integrations/NEXLA.md` (this commit). This is the
local ingress path only — **not** Nexla-integration proof; the live FlexFlow flow (ROADMAP
"prove the event ID end to end") is still open and key-gated.
### 2026-07-17 — A1: Zero evidence adapter service (lane A, `feat/zero-live`)

**Built.** New `services/zero-adapter` workspace (`@continuim/zero-adapter`) — the small
HTTP adapter `services/verification/src/collector.ts` already POSTs to in `live_zero` mode.
`src/transport.ts` defines the `ZeroTransport` seam and `createZeroTransport(env)`, which
returns `null` unless a real Zero session (`ZERO_PRIVATE_KEY`) is present. `src/adapter.ts`
holds `buildEvidenceResponse` (flattens settled Zero calls into normalized
`EvidenceSignal[]`, reusing one `receiptId`/cost across every signal a paid call backs, and
rejecting a paid call with no receipt) and the pure `handleEvidenceRequest` (bearer check
on `ZERO_EVIDENCE_ADAPTER_TOKEN`, routing `POST /v1/evidence` + `GET /health`);
`src/server.ts` boots it on `ZERO_EVIDENCE_ADAPTER_PORT` (default 4100 — the canonical
`ZERO_EVIDENCE_ADAPTER_URL` already in `config/example.env`). With no Zero session a runtime
request returns **503 "Zero session not configured"** — it never fabricates fixture-shaped
`live_zero` data (STRATEGY-LEDGER decision 0010). The live catalog (exact service
IDs/prices/receipts) is settled later in item A4; `LiveZeroTransport.gather` refuses until
then rather than invent evidence.

**Verified (this commit).** `npm run check` green in worktree A — `tsc --noEmit` clean,
`npm test` 26/26 pass (15 pre-existing + 11 new in
`services/zero-adapter/src/adapter.test.ts`, all using a fake injected Zero transport).
Booted standalone on port 4110: `GET /health` → `{"ok":true,"sessionConfigured":false}`;
unkeyed `POST /v1/evidence` → HTTP 503 `{"error":"Zero session not configured"}` (no
`signals`). Root `package.json` `test` script appended with the new test file (end of list,
per lane-A contract).

**Open.** ROADMAP "Zero evidence adapter with real receipt IDs" (line 19) stays unticked —
real receipts require A4 live settlement against a funded wallet; A1 delivers only the
contract + receipt-reuse plumbing, fake-transport verified. `config/example.env` now uses
`ZERO_PRIVATE_KEY` as the live Zero session gate.
scheduled. Evidence recorded in `docs/integrations/NEXLA.md`. This is the local ingress path
only — **not** Nexla-integration proof; the live FlexFlow flow (ROADMAP "prove the event ID
end to end") is still open and key-gated.

**C3 — FlexFlow design.** Authored the Nexla FlexFlow design in `docs/integrations/NEXLA.md`:
webhook source → v1.1 attribute transform (with a field-mapping table bound to
`packages/contracts` `StockoutRiskEvent`) → `currentQty <= threshold` filter → authenticated
webhook destination `POST /api/events/stockout` carrying `X-StockShield-Webhook-Secret`.
Design of record only — not yet configured in Nexla (no keys).

### 2026-07-17 — A2 + A3: Zero candidate catalog + downtime citation research (lane A)

**A2 — Zero live catalog re-verified** at `zero.xyz/browse` on 2026-07-17 (CLAUDE.md decision
3). Concrete EvidenceKind → service mapping recorded in `docs/integrations/ZERO.md`
("Candidate Live Services") as **candidates, not verified**; `config/zero-services.json`
`verifiedAt` stays `null`. Key findings: `company_identity_match` → Wiza Company Enrichment
($0.02) or PDL Company Enrich ($0.10); `domain_age_days` → Domain Availability Checker (RDAP,
$0.001) — the required WHOIS/domain-age candidate, but A4 must confirm it returns the
registration date, not just availability; `web_presence` → Firecrawl Scrape ($0.0126);
`news_presence` → Serper Google News ($0.04); `contact_reachable` → StablePhone AI Call
($0.54, A8-gated). **No bank/payee-verification and no typosquat service exist in the
catalog** — `payee_identity_match` is derived from the company-enrichment call (shared
receipt) and `typosquat_detected` is computed locally. All five `REQUIRED_SIGNALS` are
reachable; estimated required-bundle spend ≈ $0.03–0.13/vendor.

**A3 — Downtime-rate citation** (posted to the board as a `note` for W3/A7). Operator-specific
figure: **Ponemon Institute, "2016 Cost of Data Center Outages" — average $8,851 per minute**
(≈885,100 cents/min; max ~$17,244/min), up from $7,908/min (2013) and $5,617/min (2010);
sponsored by Emerson Network Power/Vertiv. Corroboration: Uptime Institute (approaching
$9,000/min; 70% of outages >$100k, 25% >$1M) and ITIC (hourly cost >$300k for 88% of
enterprises, >$1M/hr for 40%). Current placeholder in `services/verification/src/scenarios.ts`
is `downtimeCostCentsPerMinute: 18_000` ($180/min, datacenter) — A7 replaces it with a cited,
honestly-scoped value (whole-facility Ponemon average vs a scoped single-stockout fraction is
a PM/A7 call). Primary source: https://www.ponemon.org/research/ponemon-library/security/2016-cost-of-data-center-outages.html
### 2026-07-17 — Lane B / B3: StableEmail PO-receipt module (EMAIL_MODE=off default)

**Built.** `services/procurement/src/email.ts` — an injectable email transport for
post-201 PO receipts with two disclosed paths selected by `EMAIL_MODE` (default
`off`): `stableemail` (Zero sponsor path; returns `messageId` + `zeroReceiptId`) and
`fallback` (a disclosed **non-Zero** path, `sponsor:"none"`, never claimed as a Zero
tool — decisions 0010/0014). Off-by-default returns a null transport; live modes fail
closed when their URL/recipient env is missing (no silent degrade). Post-201
fire-and-forget hook wired in `services/procurement/src/server.ts` after the response
is written; dedupes by PO id so an idempotent `201` replay does not re-send. No
`packages/contracts` change. New `email.test.ts` (off-default, fail-closed, disclosed
fallback label, exactly-once) appended to the root `test` script.

**Verified (this commit).** `npm run check` green in worktree `.claude/worktrees/B`:
`tsc --noEmit` clean; `node:test` **18/18** pass (15 preexisting unchanged + 3 new).
Live StableEmail send remains B7 (key-gated); this lands the module only.

**Requested (board → PM).** `config/example.env` EMAIL_* lines (PM-owned hotspot) and
a decision on where the StableEmail runbook lives (ZERO.md vs a new EMAIL.md).

### 2026-07-17 — Lane B / B1: final vendor PPL + exact Pomerium Zero runbook

**Documented.** `infra/pomerium/vendor-policy.example.yaml` finalized — corrected the
misleading "replace the user id" comment: the vendor service-account **User ID must be
set to exactly `vendor:vendor-northstar`** so it satisfies both the route policy
(`user.is`) and the origin check `sub == vendor:<vendorId>`
(`services/procurement/src/authorize.ts`). `docs/integrations/POMERIUM.md` expanded into
an exact click-path/CLI runbook: self-hosted data-plane topology (hosted control plane +
proxy in the compose/Akash network via `POMERIUM_ZERO_TOKEN`, reaching `procurement:4001`
directly — **no separate tunnel/connector needed**), service-account steps, route
creation (From/To + Pass Identity Headers / `pass_identity_headers: true`), policy paste,
and a `POMERIUM_*` env-derivation table. Facts verified against pomerium.com docs:
assertion header `X-Pomerium-Jwt-Assertion`, JWKS `/.well-known/pomerium/jwks.json`,
service-account User ID == policy `user.is`, client `Authorization: Bearer Pomerium-<token>`.

**Not yet live.** Cluster/route/service-account creation + PPL application + `403`/`201`
capture are B5/B6 (key-gated, token-serialized); confirm any renamed console labels then.
---

## 2026-07-17 — Rename to Continuim + kedar mockup merge (this commit)

**Decision 0016 (supersede).** The public product is renamed **StockShield → Continuim**
by explicit user direction. Global case-aware rename across 60 tracked files: all docs,
package scope `@stockshield/*` → `@continuim/*` (imports + lockfile + node_modules
symlinks reinstalled), dashboard UI strings, compose/deploy files, and the architecture
SVG. `logs/*.jsonl` history untouched (append-only); ledger entry 16 records the
supersede of the naming in 0006/0013.

**Branch merge.** `origin/kedar/docs-and-mockup` (one commit, mockup redesign) merged
into `main`; the redesign was built on the pre-rename mockup, so its reintroduced
"Vendor Fraud Interceptor" branding, `Fillmore` PO step (violates 0004), and
"Fraud score"/"Fraud blocked" labels (violate 0003/0008/0010) were surgically rebranded
inside kedar's structure: product name → Continuim, Fillmore → StableEmail, fraud
labels → risk/at-risk-spend labels. Kedar's remote branch deleted after merge
(single-branch workflow).

**Verified (this commit).** `npm test` 15/15 pass; `npm run typecheck` clean after
workspace reinstall.

---

## 2026-07-17 — Diagram upgrade + cohesion pass (this commit)

**Diagrams.** `docs/assets/architecture.svg` rebuilt as a three-layer diagram matching
decision 0015 — Hero Runway / Secondary Guardrail / Learning bands, numbered demo beats
(1 stockout → 2 unattested attempt → 3 403 replan → 4 paid evidence → 5–6 verdict +
capability → 7 201), learning feedback arrow labeled "gate still required", and the
scenario + sponsor footer. Render verified via Quick Look rasterization.
`docs/architecture.md` gains two GitHub-rendered mermaid diagrams (three-layer flowchart
+ runtime sequence) alongside the existing text flow.

**Cohesion.** Post-rename sweep: remaining StockShield/ProcureLoop mentions are only
historical records in the ledger, PRD decision log, and this file (intentional). PRD
naming citation corrected to DECISIONS 0016. Mockup title, dashboard metadata, and all
package scopes confirmed Continuim.

**Verified (this commit).** `npm test` 15/15 pass; `npm run typecheck` clean.

### 2026-07-17 — PM: reconciled origin/main (Continuim rename + Continuum frontend) into the wave

**Merged.** `origin/main` (`89d54bf`: decision 0016 rename StockShield→Continuim across
104 files; `Continuum/` Next.js frontend upload; kedar mockup redesign) merged into the
wave's `main` (was `1422abd`). One content conflict (`docs/integrations/NEXLA.md`) —
resolved by keeping the wave's richer C1/C3 content and applying the rename to it, incl.
the webhook header now being `X-Continuim-Webhook-Secret` (`services/control-plane/src/server.ts:100`).
Wave-new files swept `@stockshield` → `@continuim` (`services/zero-adapter/*`,
`services/procurement/src/email.*`). Verified: `npm install` relinked workspaces,
`npm run check` green 29/29 under the new scope. Lanes A–D continue on pre-rename
worktrees; the rename is absorbed at each lane's next merge (lazy rebase per the human's
call). `Continuum/` frontend role: under tab-E investigation before any dashboard decision.
**C2 — event-ID chip + mode badges.** Surgical dashboard edits (chips/badges/labels only,
per the pending UI handoff): added a legible monospace event-ID/correlation chip in the
decision-trace header (renders the run's `correlationId`, e.g. `nexla-event-001`) and a new
authorization-mode badge (`Pomerium` / `Development`) beside the existing verification badge
(`Live Zero` / `Fixture evidence`) in `apps/dashboard/components/operations-dashboard.tsx`
(+ `.mode.pomerium` and `.eventChip` rules in `apps/dashboard/app/styles.css`). Verified:
`npm run build:web` green; a headless render of the lane-C stack confirmed both badges and
the chip legible for **fixture+development** (chip `nexla-event-001`) and **fixture+pomerium**
(blue `Pomerium`, computed `#1c5b88` on `#e1f0fa`), no console errors. The `Live Zero` label
is the pre-existing verification conditional (unchanged), reachable only with the live Zero
adapter (deferred to W2/C6).

**C4 — DEMO.md rehearsal hardening.** Rewrote the "Before Recording" prose in `docs/DEMO.md`
into an explicit 5-step pre-rehearsal checklist, run before recording **and before every
denial rehearsal**: (1) `doctor:prize` + `check` green; (2) hard-reset the incident ledger
(`{"hard":true}`) before EVERY denial rehearsal — flagged the #1 rehearsal failure, since the
Learning Layer otherwise suppresses the prize-critical 403 beat; (3) datacenter scenario lock
with a code-verified caveat (`store.reset` clears the decision trail but not the incident
ledger, so a scenario switch needs a follow-up hard-reset); (4) confirm `Live Zero` /
`Pomerium` badges; (5) stage proof tabs + record continuous. Doc only; canonical port 4000
preserved.

### 2026-07-17 — Lane C: C5 runbook pre-draft (post-reconciliation idle prep)

**C5 prep (idle-time, PM-sanctioned).** After C1–C4 merged (main `2bcd1be`) and the branch
was rebased even with main, pre-drafted the Nexla console setup runbook in
`docs/integrations/NEXLA.md` (§ "Nexla console setup") from C3's FlexFlow design: the 5-step
console click-path (webhook source → v1.1 transform → `currentQty <= threshold` filter →
webhook destination with `X-Continuim-Webhook-Secret`) plus an activate-and-capture proof
step (Nexla flow ID + event ID → matching `correlationId` in the Continuim trail). Design/plan
only — no Nexla account is provisioned; exact console labels + ingest URL are captured live
when C5 runs (key- and token-gated).

### 2026-07-17 — Lane B / B4: Akash prep — local image build + SDL marker procedure

**Verified.** `docker build .` succeeds in worktree `.claude/worktrees/B` → image
`stockshield:local` (`sha256:78e9506390b3`, 987 MB). The in-container `npm run build`
(tsc + `node:test` + Next production build) passed. The single-stage image ships
devDependencies (987 MB) — fine for coverage, not on the demo critical path.

**Documented.** `docs/integrations/AKASH.md` carries the concrete procedure: local
build (B4), GHCR publish with an immutable tag, prefer the pushed `@sha256` digest, and
a `sed` marker-replace for both `REPLACE_OWNER`/`REPLACE_SHA` across the three
`deploy/akash/deploy.example.yaml` image lines. Akash publish/lease stays B8 (gated on
`doctor:prize` ∧ `build` ∧ `docker compose up --build`).

### 2026-07-17 — Lane B / B2: prize-mode compose topology (config valid; up-health deferred)

**Verified.** `docker compose config` VALID (exit 0). procurement stays `expose`-only
(no published host port); control-plane `4000`, dashboard `3000` published as before.

**Documented.** Added a commented prize-mode `pomerium` proxy block to `compose.yaml`:
the Pomerium Zero self-hosted data plane runs in the same network and reaches
`procurement:4001` directly — **no separate tunnel/connector needed**. The default dev
`up` is unchanged (block commented; `AUTH_MODE` stays `development`).

**Deferred (not yet done).** `docker compose up --build` health binds `3000:3000` +
`4000:4000`; port `4000` is held by an unrelated LiteLLM proxy (a worker cannot free it).
token-request posted — PM to coordinate freeing `4000`, or approve an alternate-host-port
run that verifies the same internal topology (container healthchecks curl `127.0.0.1`
inside each container, so they do not depend on the host-port bind). B2 completes when
up-health is green.

### 2026-07-17 — Lane B rebased onto Continuim main + residual @stockshield sweep

**Rebased.** `feat/pomerium-live` rebased onto reconciled `main` (StockShield→Continuim,
decision 0016). B4 (now `8a57856`) + B2 (now `d2aa9da`) replayed with no conflicts;
CURRENT_STATE union-merged cleanly. Post-rebase files carry main's Continuim naming + my
B2 pomerium block + B3 post-201 hook (`server.ts` header `x-continuim-request-id`).

**Swept (lane B files).** The rename sweep had missed files merged in the B3 window.
Fixed: `services/procurement/src/email.ts` + `email.test.ts` imported now-dead
`@stockshield/contracts` → `@continuim/contracts`; email subject "StockShield PO" →
"Continuim PO"; `docs/integrations/AKASH.md` image/repo names `stockshield` → `continuim`
(matches the Continuim deploy SDL). `grep -i stockshield` over lane B is now clean;
`npm run check` 29/29 on the current tree (email.test.ts imports `@continuim/contracts`).

**BLOCKER (lane A, flagged to PM).** A CLEAN `npm install` still fails repo-wide with 404
`@stockshield/contracts@*` from `services/zero-adapter/**` (lane A, single-writer):
`package.json` (name `@stockshield/zero-adapter` + `@stockshield/contracts` dep) and
`adapter.ts`/`adapter.test.ts`/`transport.ts` imports. Until A sweeps zero-adapter, a
clean-install certification is not possible; the current check green runs on an existing
(dirty) node_modules. Evidence in `logs/errors.jsonl`.

### 2026-07-17 — Lane B second rebase onto a304389 + clean verification + B2 up-health

**Resolved.** The lane-A zero-adapter blocker above was fixed upstream by main's `8ae16d1`
(lane C completed the `@continuim` sweep the reconciliation merge had left in a stale
index). Second rebase of `feat/pomerium-live` onto `a304389` is clean — my redundant
email.* import hunks auto-dropped, my unique changes kept (email subject "Continuim PO";
AKASH.md continuim image names). Post-rebase shas: **B4 `19ebc58`, B2 `b02e6a9`,
sweep `559f73d`**.

**Verified (clean tree).** `npm install` clean (0 vulnerabilities, no 404);
`npm run check` **29/29** (`tsc --noEmit` clean; full node:test suite incl. zero-adapter
+ email).

**B2 up-health — DONE (PM option 2: alternate host ports 13000/14000, no token).**
`docker compose -f compose.yaml -f <alt-ports override> -p continuim-b-alt up --build -d
--wait` → exit 0; all three services **Healthy**. `procurement` stayed **expose-only**
(`4001/tcp`, no host port — prize boundary holds); `control-plane` 14000→4000 healthy
(`/health` = `{"ok":true,…authorizationMode:"development"…}`); `dashboard` 13000→3000
HTTP 200. Canonical `3000/4000` never bound (4000 still the unrelated LiteLLM). The
canonical `4000:4000` up-health stays a one-time pre-W2 PM step (human pre-authorized
stopping LiteLLM). Override file is throwaway (scratchpad, uncommitted); stack torn down.
### 2026-07-17 — A pre-key: LiveZeroTransport.gather implemented (lane A, de-risks A4)

**Built.** Per PM directive `feadffd5`, implemented the real evidence-gathering path in
`services/zero-adapter` behind an injectable `ZeroClient` seam so A4 collapses to
run-and-record. `src/signals.ts` — pure mappers (enrichment → company + payee sharing one
receipt; RDAP → `domain_age_days`, omitted when no registration date; Firecrawl →
`web_presence`; Serper → `news_presence`; `typosquat_detected` stays local in the policy).
`src/transport.ts` — `LiveZeroTransport.gather` orchestrates the four A2 candidate services;
`CliZeroClient` runs the verified `zero` CLI model (`zero fetch … --json` →
`{runId,ok,payment,body}`), guarded so real calls fire only with `ZERO_PRIVATE_KEY` (still 503
without) and refuse loudly on unsettled capability coordinates. Fixed a self-referential
payee-match fallback caught while writing tests. ZERO.md gained the invocation model, the
`ZERO_PRIVATE_KEY` credential note, and the A4 settle checklist.

**Verified (this commit).** `npm run check` green — `tsc` clean; `npm test` 33/33 (7 new in
`services/zero-adapter/src/transport.test.ts`, all fake-client, no CLI/wallet/network).
Re-booted standalone on :4110: health `sessionConfigured:false`, unkeyed `POST /v1/evidence`
→ HTTP 503 (unchanged). Root `package.json` `test` appended with the new file.

**Open / for A4.** Per-service `capabilityUrl`/`capabilityToken` (from `zero get`) + exact
`body`/`payment` shapes settled against live responses (ZERO.md A4 checklist). **Rebased**
onto Continuim main (`@continuim`, decision 0016); gate flipped `ZERO_API_KEY` →
`ZERO_PRIVATE_KEY` (adopted, `config/example.env` 192724f); 503-when-absent unchanged.
**E1+E2 — Continuum frontend investigated, then wired to live `/api/state` (read-path,
supplement mode).** E1 (commit `d26a98b`, merged `bd6ed41`): `Continuum/INTEGRATION-NOTES.md`
maps every Continuum page to its control-plane surface, catalogs mock-vs-real data, and
confirms `Continuum/` builds standalone (`npm install` + `next build` green, 14 routes).
E2: wired the ops pages to real run data through the existing `useContinuum()` seam without
touching the proven `apps/dashboard` demo screen (still the demo-of-record). New in
`Continuum/**`: a same-origin proxy `src/app/api/control/[...path]/route.ts` (mirrors the
dashboard proxy; target `CONTROL_PLANE_INTERNAL_URL ?? http://127.0.0.1:4000`), a 1 Hz
`useLiveState()` poller, a local `DemoState` type mirror (`src/lib/live/contracts.ts`), and
`adaptWorkspace()` (`src/lib/live/adapt.ts`) overlaying real `/api/state` data onto the
view-model. `store.tsx` serves live-adapted `workspace` when the control-plane is reachable
(mock fallback otherwise) and exposes `live`/`liveState`; `KpiGrid`, `SupplierGrid`, and
`OpsShell` are live-aware (real §14 metrics under correct labels; real vendor fields; a
`LIVE · <scenarioId>` badge that shows the backend scenario id verbatim). Honesty guardrails
(per PM directive): only structured `DemoState` fields are rendered — `DecisionEvent.detail`
strings are shown verbatim, never parsed into fake structure; genuinely-absent chrome (YTD
aggregates, category breakdown, spend ceiling, integration roster) stays base/illustrative;
the `/continuum` theater remains the scripted explainer (its controls are gated write-actions).
Verified against an isolated 4600/4601 fixture/development stack: a real `POST /api/demo/run`
produced a full deny→blacklist→attest→order state (`atRiskPoValuePreventedCents=240000` =
$2,400, order `PO-01787B60`, lookalike `vendor-lookalike` blacklisted); Continuum's proxy on
`:3200` returned that state end-to-end, `adaptWorkspace()` mapped it correctly, and Continuum
`next build` is green (proxy now a dynamic `ƒ /api/control/[...path]` route). Read-only — no
write buttons wired (gated pending PM directive).

### 2026-07-17 — PM: merged origin/main 465d2f3 (teammate live-integration wiring) into the wave

**Merged.** External commit `465d2f3` (Aayush Baniya): env convention flipped
`.env.local`→`.env` (all npm scripts + doctor), standalone `scripts/evidence-adapter.ts`
(direct Firecrawl/Apify/Linkup providers), `services/control-plane/src/bedrock.ts`
explainer + runtime wiring + contracts `DecisionPhase "explained"`, Pomerium subject
aliases in authorize, Akash console SDL, zero-hello page. Conflicts resolved:
package.json (their `.env` flags + `dev:evidence`, our fuller test list),
config/example.env (union of ZERO_PRIVATE_KEY block + their provider/Bedrock blocks).
Verified `npm run check` 37/37 post-resolution. **Resolved follow-up:** root
`dev:evidence` and `start:evidence` now run `services/zero-adapter/src/server.ts`, the
settled Zero adapter path. The direct-provider `scripts/evidence-adapter.ts` is legacy
scratch code and is not the default runtime. **Open reconciliations:** two Bedrock explainers
(this `bedrock.ts` on main vs lane D's held
`claude.ts`) — reconcile at W3 D-merge; contracts change landed without all-owner ack
(retroactive ack requested on the board).
**E2 merged + live-verified; live-mode operational caveat; E3 assigned (post-E2 follow-up).**
E2 merged to `main` (`4db78dc merge(E)`); PM + the human verified the canonical Continuum UI
end-to-end on `:3200` (main checkout) against the `:4000` backend — a real monitor-triggered
run flowed through 14 decision phases to `PO-26DAE48E`, read back through the Continuum proxy
(source: board directive `20c762e5`, main `4db78dc`). **Live-mode caveat:** sponsor keys placed
in the human-owned env file do **not** take effect until the control-plane **process is
restarted** in the target mode. A read-only `/health` probe on canonical `:4000` showed
`verificationMode=fixture, authorizationMode=development` even after keys were added, and PM
confirmed canonical is deliberately held at fixture because `VERIFICATION_MODE=live_zero` fails
closed at boot without Zero config (board pin `94a2db0b`); modes flip per-sponsor at each proof
session. Continuum's `LIVE · <scenarioId>` badge therefore honestly reads fixture/development
until the backend is relaunched live — E2's read-path is mode-agnostic and needs no change to
surface `live_zero`/`pomerium` once it is. **Ports:** `:3200` = canonical Continuum UI (PM-held
while the token is held); lane-E testing moved to `:3201` (own stack `:4600`/`:4601` freed).
**Held:** Continuum write-path buttons (run/reset/scenario/consume) intentionally not wired —
pending explicit human/PM decision + token (they trigger real runs on the canonical stack).
**Next (assigned):** E3 — wire Continuum incidents + learning pages to the real `/api/state`
learning ledger (incident records, proven-vendor history, `recalled_history`); read-path only,
same honesty contract as E2 (board directive `8023537d`).

**E3 — Continuum incidents + learning pages wired to the live learning ledger (read-path).**
Replaced the `/incidents` and `/learning` redirect stubs with real pages that render the
control-plane learning ledger live through the `useContinuum()` seam (mock fallback when the
control-plane is unreachable, clearly labelled). `/learning`: incidents-resolved / last-resolution
/ proven-vendor tiles, a proven-vendor history list (name + domain, resolved from
`learning.provenVendorIds` → `vendors[]`), and a recall & reasoning feed (`recalled_history` /
`explained` / `attested` / `ordered` events, detail strings rendered verbatim). `/incidents`: the
live incident (scenario, SKU on-hand vs threshold, 403 + `deniedRequestId`, recovered PO + inbound)
plus the aggregate count; the page honestly notes per-incident `IncidentRecord[]` history is **not**
exposed by `/api/state` (SQLite-only) rather than fabricating a history table. New helpers in
`Continuum/src/lib/live/adapt.ts` (`provenVendorList`, `learningFeed`, `currentIncident`); synced the
local `DemoState` mirror + phase maps with the control-plane's new `explained` `DecisionPhase`
(contracts, main `6c8dd8c`) and made phase lookups fallback-safe (unknown future phases degrade to a
title-cased label instead of `undefined`). `OpsShell` nav gains Incidents + Learning links. Files:
`Continuum/src/app/{incidents,learning}/page.tsx`, `Continuum/src/lib/live/{adapt,contracts}.ts`,
`Continuum/src/components/layout/OpsShell.tsx`. Verified against an isolated 4600/4601 fixture/dev
stack: two `/api/demo/run`s (soft reset between) produced `learning.incidentCount=2`, proven
`vendor-northstar`, a real `recalled_history` event, order `PO-509FE8CF`; a headless-browser load of
`http://127.0.0.1:3201/learning` (proxy → :4600) rendered the live ledger — `LIVE · datacenter`
badge, "Northstar Supply" proven, 2 incidents resolved / 339ms tiles, the recall event — screenshot
captured. `next build` green (14 routes; `/learning`, `/incidents` now real pages). Read-only — no
write buttons.
### 2026-07-17 — Lane C: C5 console-side (authenticated ingress verified; console/canonical gated)

**C5 GO console-side (directive `f21ddeed`).** Nexla keys landed (`NEXLA_WEBHOOK_SECRET` +
`NEXLA_API_KEY` in main `.env`). Rebased onto current main (`dce90ce`), `npm install` clean.
Verified the authenticated Nexla-destination handshake on the isolated lane-C stack
(`:4400`/`:4401`, dev/fixture, **test secret** — the real `.env` secret is never read into a
worktree): missing header → `401`, wrong secret → `401`, correct `X-Continuim-Webhook-Secret`
→ `202 {"accepted":true,"eventId":"nexla-event-001"}`; the accepted run drained to `complete`
with `correlationId == "nexla-event-001"` end to end. Evidence in `docs/integrations/NEXLA.md`
(§ "Authenticated ingress verified"). **Still gated:** the actual Nexla-console flow build is
human-legs (needs console access + `NEXLA_API_KEY`; this lane has no Nexla API tool and never
touches the main `.env`), and the live canonical `:4000` delivery is token-serialized (sequence
A → B → PM slice → C). ROADMAP "prove the event ID end to end" stays open until that live run.

### 2026-07-17 — Client console: persisted control-plane recovery trace

**Built.** The `/datacenter` client console now keeps only GPU telemetry synthetic and explicitly
labeled as such. A detector-confirmed client fault calls `POST /api/demo/client-incident`; its
timeout-based agent bridge was removed. The console polls same-origin control-plane state and renders
persisted `DecisionEvent`s as the agent trace, so denial, verification, attestation, ordering, and
inbound scheduling are shown from SQLite-backed state. The client incident is persisted too, so a
page refresh retains the originating node and fault while the run is visible in the agent view.

**Verified.** `npm run check` passed (**38/38**) and `npm --prefix Continuum run build` passed.
Against an isolated fixture/development stack (ports 4500/4501/4502), the production client proxy
accepted `gpu-07` / `node_offline`, the monitor started the real loop, and SQLite passed
`PRAGMA integrity_check` (`ok`) with `demo_state=1`, `decision_events=14`, and `incidents=1`.
The recovery trace reached a signed PO and scheduled inbound supply. No paid provider call was made.

### 2026-07-17 — A4: Zero settle lock landed + lane-A spot-verify (KEEP: Zero receipts)

**Verified (spot, per bfe48689).** PM landed the settle lock (62db3b7) from the teammate's relayed
zero-CLI receipts — 3 services: `company_identity_match` (cap_fHxedyuNDjC6grLLINJYM /
run_HzNTkaRe4v4Hgbd4zuH8y), `domain_age_days` (cap_PYHZbk2tn2qaZty-h5qNC / run_VKcZYwoHgXgWyCC_OdQLg),
`web_presence` (cap_gimcJl-eOG0JdEAyZkDjG / run_93ZYeks9toPjfxOWxp_La); all 1c (~3c total, far under
the 500c ceiling / 100c per-call stop). Non-exhaustive spot-verify: `verifiedAt` + `walletNetwork`
set, 3 real receipts, format matches ZERO.md; `npm run check` 38/38; `npm run doctor:prize` "Zero
service lock" row **PASS**. Observed latency + exact wallet-network marked PENDING the owner's full
session export — honest-pending, not fabricated (decision 0010). The teammate's `zero auth login`
gate patch (`hasZeroSession`) is merged + green; the adapter reaches the owner's remote instance via
`ZERO_EVIDENCE_ADAPTER_URL` (the HTTP seam's designed remote path). ROADMAP settle + adapter boxes
ticked. Token released — wallet leg done.
