## Changelog (append-only, newest at bottom)

### 2026-07-17 — Project scaffolded + concept locked

**Setup.** Doc system + anti-drift mechanisms laid down (vendored `starter-pack/`):
constitution (`CLAUDE.md`), placeholder `vision.md` (user approval pending — left
editable), this log, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/architecture.md`,
`docs/STRATEGY-LEDGER.md` (+ SessionStart injection hook), `docs/lessons_learned.md`,
`logs/DECISIONS.jsonl` (seeded 0001–0005) + `logs/errors.jsonl` (empty), and the
enforcement layer (`scripts/bootstrap.sh`: chmod 444 + pre-commit on vision/CLAUDE/architecture).

**Concept decided.** After multi-round brainstorming and a deep-research pass (103 sub-agents,
verified against `zero.xyz/browse`, the `zero-plugins` repo, Metaview and Nexla docs), the
team converged on **Aegis** — an autonomous procurement agent whose stockout-rescue loop has
fraud defense built into every step. Full rationale and the rejected alternatives (Concepts
A/B/C and pure-software ideas) are in `docs/STRATEGY-LEDGER.md` decisions 2–5 and `docs/PRD.md`.

**Key research findings that shaped the design** (source: deep-research report, 2026-07-17):
- Zero.xyz does NOT broker credit-bureau / supplier-registry / fraud-score / freight data
  (kills the original Concepts A/B/C paid steps) → verify via enrichment + scrape + news +
  AI call instead (`STRATEGY-LEDGER` decision 3).
- Fillmore is recruiting-only → dropped; PO email via StableEmail (decision 4).
- Nexla FlexFlow (GA) is the trigger layer, not MCP Studio (Early Access) (decision 5).

**Not yet built.** No application code exists. Next session starts at `docs/ROADMAP.md`
Phase 0 → freeze the five interface signatures, then parallel build.

### 2026-07-17 — Infrastructure doc + judge-facing README

**Added.** `docs/infrastructure.md` — the end-to-end runtime infra: topology diagram, the
five deployable units + ports/trust-boundaries, the Pomerium-gated `POST /po` request path
step by step (how the `403` physically happens), the Zero.xyz x402 paid-call plumbing, the
Nexla trigger, secrets handling, and local-vs-Akash deployment (local-first; Akash is P2
coverage). Also added a public **`README.md`** (judge-facing): problem, the trust-loop, the
tool mapping, the embedded topology diagram (linking to the full infra doc), repo layout,
local quickstart, and the team split. `.gitignore` extended (user) to cover `data/`,
`coverage/`, `*.tsbuildinfo`. Key infra invariant documented: `services/procurement` is
reachable **only** through Pomerium — no route exists for the agent to bypass the gate.

### 2026-07-17 — Green vertical slice: monitor, signed attestations, pre-verification denial, infra

**Built (working tree integrated this session; tests 9/9, `tsc --noEmit` clean).**
The full local vertical slice now exists and runs: always-on inventory monitor
(`services/control-plane/src/monitor.ts`, 2s interval, threshold + idle + no-inbound guards);
agent loop that attempts the cheapest **unattested** PO first, observes the live 403, replans,
buys evidence, and orders with a signed capability (`services/agent/src/index.ts`);
HMAC-signed quote/payee/amount-bound `VendorAttestation` with nonce replay defense
(`packages/security`, `services/procurement`); deterministic vendor-risk policy v1.1
(`services/verification/src/policy.ts`); pluggable fixture/live_zero evidence collector
(`collector.ts`); Nexla webhook ingress (`POST /api/events/stockout`); ops dashboard with
decision trail. Infra: `Dockerfile`, `compose.yaml`, `deploy/akash/deploy.example.yaml`,
`infra/pomerium/vendor-policy.example.yaml`, `scripts/doctor.ts` readiness checker,
integration runbooks under `docs/integrations/` (ZERO, POMERIUM, NEXLA, AKASH), `docs/DEMO.md`
3-minute script, `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Decisions 0006–0010 recorded in `logs/DECISIONS.jsonl`.
Pending on-site: Zero service lock (`config/zero-services.json` empty), Pomerium route +
service accounts, StableEmail adapter, Nexla FlexFlow config, Akash deploy (P2).

### 2026-07-17 — Integration: branches merged, hero/subset reframe, horizontal scenario engine

**Merged.** `origin/main` (fd7cbe6: BUSINESS, PRODUCT_SCOPE, CASE_STUDIES, client mockup)
into `dev`; cherry-picked `toolsused.md` and the user-authored `vision.md` from
`origin/ayush` (that branch shares no git history with dev — a full merge would have
deleted the codebase, so files were adopted instead).

**Reframed (decision 0013, `logs/DECISIONS.jsonl`).** The hero across all docs is the
autonomous emergency-procurement rescue loop; vendor-risk/fraud defense is its built-in
trust subset. Applied to README, PRD, PROJECT_STATUS, STRATEGY-LEDGER (entry 13),
BUSINESS, CASE_STUDIES, PRODUCT_SCOPE, mockup titles. Contradictions with settled
decisions corrected in place: PRODUCT_SCOPE mock-registry mitigation (0003), Fillmore
stretch (0004), toolsused.md LLM-as-decider and Resend-first (0008/0004 — reconciliation
notes added; see also `docs/blueprint-reconciliation.md`, decision 0014).

**Built.** Horizontal scenario-profile engine (`services/verification/src/scenarios.ts`):
`datacenter` (default, DDR5-ECC-64GB + existing vendor pair) and `apparel`
(NAVY-DYE-20L, vendor-pacificdye typosquat vs vendor-meridian) run the identical loop;
`POST /api/demo/scenario` + dashboard toggle (disabled mid-run); scenario block on
`DemoState` (SCHEMA_VERSION unchanged, additive). New `scenarios.test.ts`.

**Verified (this commit).** `npm test` 11/11 pass; `npm run typecheck` exit 0;
`npm run build` exit 0. DEMO.md gained the optional "same loop, any industry" closer;
ROADMAP scenario-engine box ticked.

### 2026-07-17 — Learning Layer, exhaustive docs, advisor audit fixes, single-branch consolidation

**Built.** Learning Layer landed per decision 0015: `incidents` SQLite ledger written on
`complete()`; `DemoState.learning` (count, last resolution, proven vendors); `history()`
drives the loop — later runs emit `recalled_history` instead of the unattested probe and
rank proven vendors first; soft reset preserves the ledger, `POST /api/demo/reset
{"hard":true}` clears it; dashboard learning strip + Proven chips. New tests:
`services/agent/src/learning.test.ts`, `services/control-plane/src/store.test.ts`.

**Documented.** `docs/PRD.md` rewritten as the exhaustive product document (1,194 lines,
19 sections incl. decision index + glossary); new `docs/SYSTEM.md` (1,106 lines) — the
complete technical reference read from the code.

**Advisor audit (docs↔docs + docs↔code lenses) findings fixed:** stale 11/11 test counts
→ 15/15 (PRD); demo-script pointer `PRD §9` → `§14` (CLAUDE.md, STRATEGY-LEDGER);
SYSTEM.md §12 updated from "landing" to "landed", §13 test inventory 7→9 files, reset
endpoint hard-flag documented; `SCENARIO=datacenter` added to `config/example.env`;
**docs/DEMO.md now requires a hard reset before recording** — the learning ledger
otherwise suppresses the prize-critical denial beat on repeat runs.

**Workflow.** Single long-lived branch: `main` only (CLAUDE.md §Branch model,
CONTRIBUTING.md updated); `dev` and `ayush` remote branches deleted after their content
was fully merged/absorbed.

**Verified (this commit).** `npm test` 15/15 pass; `npm run typecheck` clean;
`npm run build` (check + Next production build) green.

### 2026-07-17 — A1: Zero evidence adapter service (lane A, `feat/zero-live`)

**Built.** New `services/zero-adapter` workspace (`@stockshield/zero-adapter`) — the small
HTTP adapter `services/verification/src/collector.ts` already POSTs to in `live_zero` mode.
`src/transport.ts` defines the `ZeroTransport` seam and `createZeroTransport(env)`, which
returns `null` unless a real Zero session (`ZERO_API_KEY`) is present. `src/adapter.ts`
holds `buildEvidenceResponse` (flattens settled Zero calls into normalized
`EvidenceSignal[]`, reusing one `receiptId`/cost across every signal a paid call backs, and
rejecting a paid call with no receipt) and the pure `handleEvidenceRequest` (bearer check
on `ZERO_EVIDENCE_ADAPTER_TOKEN`, routing `POST /v1/evidence` + `GET /health`);
`src/server.ts` boots it on `ZERO_EVIDENCE_ADAPTER_PORT` (default 4100 — the canonical
`ZERO_EVIDENCE_ADAPTER_URL` already in `config/example.env`). With no Zero session a runtime
request returns **503 "Zero session not configured"** — it never fabricates fixture-shaped
`live_zero` data (STRATEGY-LEDGER decision 0010). The live catalog (exact service
IDs/prices/receipts) is settled later in item A4; `LiveZeroTransport.gather` refuses until
then rather than invent evidence.

**Verified (this commit).** `npm run check` green in worktree A — `tsc --noEmit` clean,
`npm test` 26/26 pass (15 pre-existing + 11 new in
`services/zero-adapter/src/adapter.test.ts`, all using a fake injected Zero transport).
Booted standalone on port 4110: `GET /health` → `{"ok":true,"sessionConfigured":false}`;
unkeyed `POST /v1/evidence` → HTTP 503 `{"error":"Zero session not configured"}` (no
`signals`). Root `package.json` `test` script appended with the new test file (end of list,
per lane-A contract).

**Open.** ROADMAP "Zero evidence adapter with real receipt IDs" (line 19) stays unticked —
real receipts require A4 live settlement against a funded wallet; A1 delivers only the
contract + receipt-reuse plumbing, fake-transport verified. `config/example.env` needs a
`ZERO_API_KEY` line (the Zero session gate) — posted to the board for PM to land.

### 2026-07-17 — A2 + A3: Zero candidate catalog + downtime citation research (lane A)

**A2 — Zero live catalog re-verified** at `zero.xyz/browse` on 2026-07-17 (CLAUDE.md decision
3). Concrete EvidenceKind → service mapping recorded in `docs/integrations/ZERO.md`
("Candidate Live Services") as **candidates, not verified**; `config/zero-services.json`
`verifiedAt` stays `null`. Key findings: `company_identity_match` → Wiza Company Enrichment
($0.02) or PDL Company Enrich ($0.10); `domain_age_days` → Domain Availability Checker (RDAP,
$0.001) — the required WHOIS/domain-age candidate, but A4 must confirm it returns the
registration date, not just availability; `web_presence` → Firecrawl Scrape ($0.0126);
`news_presence` → Serper Google News ($0.04); `contact_reachable` → StablePhone AI Call
($0.54, A8-gated). **No bank/payee-verification and no typosquat service exist in the
catalog** — `payee_identity_match` is derived from the company-enrichment call (shared
receipt) and `typosquat_detected` is computed locally. All five `REQUIRED_SIGNALS` are
reachable; estimated required-bundle spend ≈ $0.03–0.13/vendor.

**A3 — Downtime-rate citation** (posted to the board as a `note` for W3/A7). Operator-specific
figure: **Ponemon Institute, "2016 Cost of Data Center Outages" — average $8,851 per minute**
(≈885,100 cents/min; max ~$17,244/min), up from $7,908/min (2013) and $5,617/min (2010);
sponsored by Emerson Network Power/Vertiv. Corroboration: Uptime Institute (approaching
$9,000/min; 70% of outages >$100k, 25% >$1M) and ITIC (hourly cost >$300k for 88% of
enterprises, >$1M/hr for 40%). Current placeholder in `services/verification/src/scenarios.ts`
is `downtimeCostCentsPerMinute: 18_000` ($180/min, datacenter) — A7 replaces it with a cited,
honestly-scoped value (whole-facility Ponemon average vs a scoped single-stockout fraction is
a PM/A7 call). Primary source: https://www.ponemon.org/research/ponemon-library/security/2016-cost-of-data-center-outages.html
